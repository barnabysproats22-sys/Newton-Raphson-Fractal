# Newton-Raphson-Fractal
A Java project from university the programs a class for complex numbers and polynomials, and generates an image based on the polynomial root reached when applying the Newton-Raphson Method.

Complex deals with generating complex numebrs as a class, polynomials generates polynomials. Newton implmenets the Newton-Raphson method and NewtonFractal uses all these files to generate a PDF image for a given input polynomial. An example PDF has been provided.
